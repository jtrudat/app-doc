# Installation:
No installation needed. This is a completely frontend application. Simply redirect to the provided URL and begin

# Gameplay:
upon game loading, simply choose and click the icon for either rock, paper, or scissors and view your progress against the computer for as many rounds as you like. You must have a percentage of at least 50% over 5 tries in order to win. After 5 rounds its more of a statistical game of how many trophies you can acquire and how many rounds you can go before losing.
Statistics are automatically presented on:
- the number of times you've played 
- the user's winning percentage
- number of life savers left

# Technologies:
- SCSS: notable highlights include @key-frames for animations and @media to accomodate both desktop and mobile viewing

- JAVASCRIPT: notable technologies include math.random and math.floor to create an unpredicatable selection pattern chosen by the computer

# Controls:
- Mobile: touchscreen icons of paper, rock, or scissor
- Desktop: touchscreen icons or arrow keys
  - left arrow: rock
  - down arrow: paper
  - right arrow: scissors
  - up arrow: resets the game and score

# Credits:

- Desktop use experience is designed around keyboard use with the arrows keys being used to provide the quickest and easiest responses
